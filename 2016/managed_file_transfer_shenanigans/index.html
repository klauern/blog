<p>An approach in integrating two systems which I see pretty regularly is to take
an old, or legacy file format and copy it over to another system.  The end goal
being that you would write some kind of parser on the receiving end of this file
to take and ingest that format in.</p>

<p>This is your Poor Man&rsquo;s Service Oriented Architecture, where systems either
don&rsquo;t have integration endpoints, or the work to implement all of those are
deemed too difficult and/or time consuming.  I don&rsquo;t fault anyone for wanting to
keep an old system alive (ROI is a powerful thing when it works), but having
been thrown in this pit of non-web services&rsquo; integration, you must be aware of
several considerations.</p>

<h1 id="timing-guarantees-missed-arrivals-late-deliveries-etc">Timing Guarantees, Missed Arrivals, Late Deliveries, etc.</h1>

<p>If you implement any form of <code>cron</code>-based scheduling, you need to keep a very
clearly defined processes to handle contingencies in any of the following
issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Failed Job Runs</li>
<li>Missed Delivery Timeframes</li>
<li>Late Delivery</li>
<li>Duplicate Delivery</li>
</ol>

<p>Any one of which can create mountains of trouble for you and your system.  How
you go about verifying any of the above is somewhat dependent on the use-case of
the system and the requirements that are being fulfilled.</p>

<h2 id="failed-job-runs">Failed Job Runs</h2>

<p>For failures, you&rsquo;ll <strong>need</strong> an alerting system to provide at least some
guarantee that you&rsquo;ll know when things need to be recovered or automatically
retried.  Scheduling a re-run of failed jobs has it&rsquo;s own issues, and there are
who-knows-how-many systems out there that can provide some kind of scheduling
toolkit for you to use.  Aim for the automatic if possible, as it&rsquo;s always
faster for the system to retry for you than have you try to do it at 2AM or 3AM
in the morning (these jobs never fail at 9AM or after your second cup of
coffee).</p>

<h2 id="late-delivery">Late Delivery</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s really two forms of this error&ndash;early and late delivery.  I have seldom
seen a system that had a problem with early delivery, and if it happens, it
usually just means the data isn&rsquo;t completely available or full.  I would like to
focus on Late Delivery, however, as that seems much more commonplace.</p>

<p>Late delivery can mean a lot of things for a system, such as not being able to
send a shipment out on time, not getting bills paid within some kind of Service
Level Guarantee, or even automatically kickstarting some backup or redundancy
processes that will attempt to re-run your job or re-process things.</p>

<p>The difficulty in late- or long-running processes is knowing what will occur
that way.  In a future post, I&rsquo;ll prescribe some methods to identify and fix
these issues.  For now, it&rsquo;s important to just be aware of this situation when
debugging or developing an integration/file transfer.</p>

<h2 id="duplicate-entry">Duplicate Entry</h2>

<p>Should you get in a vicious cycle of processing the same data over and over
again, there&rsquo;s&ndash;at minimum&ndash;the added load of having your systems process extra
data without need.  Worse yet, if your data is naive enough to have data in the
form of:</p>

<pre><code>--Add $20 to account X
--Subtract $100 from account X
</code></pre>

<p>and you re-process this data again and again, you&rsquo;re going to have a bad day when
someone calls in to say that they lost all their money, or <strong>nobody</strong> calls in
when they somehow accidentally got $$$$$&rsquo;s of dollars without notice.</p>

<p>You need to build in some kind of tolerance for this, and hopefully that can be
encoded in the file you&rsquo;re processing.  The ideal goal should be to make
re-processing&ndash; at worst&ndash;a wasted effort, and at best, no processing at all.
That can&rsquo;t always be the case, but it should be strived for.</p>

<h1 id="verification-and-validation">Verification and Validation</h1>

<p>What comes next is that when you get a file, you need to do both <strong>verify</strong> that
it is the file you need, and <strong>validate</strong> that it can be properly parsed.</p>

<h2 id="verification">Verification</h2>

<p>Verification is the act of assuring that the file you&rsquo;re looking at came from
the person or system you expected it to.  In broad terms, you should encrypt
files at rest, <strong>always</strong>.  This isn&rsquo;t going to cover everything, however,
because while it may prevent a man-in-the-middle attacker from subverting and/or
mucking with your system data, it doesn&rsquo;t preclude a user from using a public
key to drop something else they&rsquo;d like you to process, which shouldn&rsquo;t be
processed at all.</p>

<p>If you choose to encrypt the file, you better be using some form of Digital
Signature.  It&rsquo;s about the only means you have to verify that the person that
encrypted it was the person you wanted to get the file from.  I am not terribly
strong on this front, so I don&rsquo;t have a lot of details on this, but it&rsquo;s
something that&rsquo;s getting a lot more attention with sites like
<a href="https://keybase.io">Keybase.io</a> and the general trend of using <a href="https://github.com/blog/2144-gpg-signature-verification">GPG-signed
commits, a la, GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>

<p>Finally, we get to the Validation portion of the file.  This is simply being
able to parse the file out properly before you attempt to import it in to the
system.  Many systems do this, and I don&rsquo;t think this is a terribly difficult
part of the process to handle.  That said, I would avoid doing any kind of
transaction committal before processing the whole file.  The worst-case scenario
here is that you find that the file format isn&rsquo;t quite right, or that something
is out of alignment (a huge issue with column-delimted or CSV data), so you will
find yourself inserting the wrong columns into your system without proper
validation.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>File transfer as a service is hard.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s something that you can
take for granted as being &lsquo;just a <code>cron</code> job&rsquo;, as it&rsquo;s way more complicated than
that.  You will inevitably trip yourself up with any of these kinds of things.
I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s less likely in the SOA or web services world, but the scope
of the problem is way larger when you batch things up into a file.</p>

<p>Seldom is a file just one record or transaction.  If you are at the point that
doing SOA or some kind of API development is an issue, you&rsquo;ll find yourself
inevitably bundling up as much as you can in that file, turning what would have
been a bunch of service calls into one massive file for import.  Now your
problem is compounded by having to not just be valid on the row or record-level,
but valid at the entire boundary of the file.  What happens if it&rsquo;s incorrect?
Can you parse it out to find out where it broke?  How do you know the next file
will be correct?  Is there a way to reproduce the issue?</p>

<p>I suggest that if you find yourself using file-based transfer systems a lot,
you&rsquo;re probably solving the wrong problem.  You need to look at what you&rsquo;re
taking in, how it&rsquo;s being done, and just converting that into some kind of an
ETL tool or SOA integration.  Doing much else is just a recipe for the problems
above.  It&rsquo;s bad enough that any of these would happen, let alone having to
safeguard yourself from all of them at once.</p>
