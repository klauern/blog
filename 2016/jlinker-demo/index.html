<h1 id="modularity-in-the-jvm">Modularity in the JVM</h1>

<p>I spent some time yesterday playing with the demos for the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/quick-start">Jigsaw Project</a>,
and have something that I hope is usable for others:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/klauern/modularity">github.com/klauern/modularity</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet tried it on a Windows machine, but that&rsquo;s next on my list.  Each
of the examples in the Jigsaw Quick Start have an associated <code>run.sh</code> script
that will build the example.  I haven&rsquo;t done much documenting, but I do suggest
that if you&rsquo;re looking at these examples, you follow along with the
documentation.  It&rsquo;s pretty good, and does a much better job explaining the
steps than I can.</p>

<h2 id="jlinker-sizes">JLinker sizes</h2>

<p>The biggest reason I wanted to play with the Jigsaw features was to see how the
<code>jlink</code>er worked in terms of generating a self-contained JVM+runnable app.  I&rsquo;m
pretty happy with it, and think that it&rsquo;s pretty slick, all things considered.
The downside is just the size.  I&rsquo;m sure that it&rsquo;s a massive effort to slim down
the JVM to what is absolutely needed to run the code you have, but the smallest
example I could run on my MacBook Air was around ~33MB.  That&rsquo;s pretty good, but
still pretty large (at least compared to a similarly-written Golan project).
I think that things are probably trending even further downward, so I wouldn&rsquo;t
be surprised to see further interations of this slim it down further, or even
finding some excited hackers able to shrink it even further themselves.  At this
point, I&rsquo;m really hopeful, and think that this is a pretty nice addition the
JVM.  More competition is always a good thing.</p>
