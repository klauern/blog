      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had a problem that I thought I could toy with [Go][go] to solve.  I support a number of software
components written with a backend that heavily uses XML for definition data.  Most of these XML elements have
familiar namespace values that you would likely see in a SOAP service, or anything that used more than
your vanilla XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while XML is not even close to a new language or data format, I assumed that parsing and digging in to
XML would be pretty easy, relatively speaking.  Go has some pretty nifty ways to parse XML and JSON data&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Leadership - Testing and Training</title>

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed leadership, but I feel it comes up
again and again when I see people new to the concept of responsibility and just
having a hell of a time trying to make their way through it&amp;rsquo;s challenges.  This
is especially difficult when you get promoted from a technical position to one
that requires managing a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;military-officer-courses&#34;&gt;Military Officer Courses&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should not be a surprise to anyone that the military (and in my specific
case, the United States Armed Forces) employs a very different mentality towards
finding and training leaders than I think almost any other place does.  The
demands of a military officer, be it an Airman, Sailor, Marine, or Soldier are
all based on the understanding that by &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; being able to lead, you can cause
innumerable losses to missions, safety, equipemnt and lives.  Making a poor
choice as a Soldier in the field has life or death consequences.  It&amp;rsquo;s probably
safe to say that most corporate jobs don&amp;rsquo;t have this concern.  There just aren&amp;rsquo;t
a lot of positions in Corporate America where a bad decision is so directly
responsible for death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, the military officer programs in most branches are designed to
test your decision making skills, push your mind and body to their physical
limits, and expose your weaknesses for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; to see.  This is a somewhat brutal
way to learn about yourself, and can be very hard on your ego and self-worth.
That said, it&amp;rsquo;s an extremely direct and fast way to figure out what you are and
aren&amp;rsquo;t good at.  Often during military training exercises, it is said that a mistake on the
training ground is far better than one occured in the field.  Training lets you &lt;strong&gt;redo&lt;/strong&gt;
your mission, in hopes to learn directly from your mistakes.  The real world is far more harsh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;civilian-corporate-counterparts&#34;&gt;Civilian / Corporate Counterparts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that preamble should make it apparent that I feel leadership is a sorely
lacking skill in Corporate America.  Businesses live and die by the &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;/strong&gt;
that work in them. By being able to lead them, you do a far better job
than simply &lt;em&gt;managing&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;differences-between-leadership-and-management&#34;&gt;Differences between Leadership and Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership is simple in concept, but extremely difficult in practice.  Simply put, it&amp;rsquo;s
easy to say you are leading by&lt;/p&gt;
