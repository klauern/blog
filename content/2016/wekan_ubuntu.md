+++

As a fun side project, I have been playing a lot with [Digital
Ocean](https://digitalocean.com), [Ubuntu 16.04](http://www.ubuntu.com/server),
and building out a server from scratch using [Ansible](https://ansible.com).
I really love all three of these services, and being able to spin up a new
server, save it off as a snapshot, and destroy it, make testing out new
configurations a breeze, without the fear of losing everything.  I suppose it's
akin to the many `Dockerfile` implentations out there, too, but I have not had
the privilege of throwing together servers using Docker in any of my work, and
many companies just aren't on the Docker bandwagon, despite the hype.
