Along the same lines as my [previous post](netgearlogs), I had a need to
analyze a set of JVM Garbage Collector logs for event types.  Consider a log
entry like the following:

```

```

This kind of log entry is far from simple to understand.  I could go about
hand-writing another parser, but I don't know if it would be anywhere near the
same level of complexity.  In fact, for the most part, all I really wanted to
know was the following:

**2016-02-11T23:39:01.847-0600**: **6062789.760**: [GC2016-02-11T23:39:01.848-0600: 6062789.761: [**ParNew**

Trying to parse much else from the get-go seemed a bit much, and there's
a **lot** of output that I'd have to skip around just to find these entries.

Not knowing where to look, I threw a question out to one of my favorite go-to
tools for parsing JVM logs: [GCViewer](https://github.com/chewiebug/GCViewer).
There must be _something_ that you can use in there to parse out a log entry.
Reaching out to the developer in an issue, I was able to get pointed in the
[right direction](https://github.com/chewiebug/GCViewer/issues/164#issuecomment-195405552):

I looked at #2, and found that this makes parsing a log file relatively
painless, and gives you a lot in the way of structural analysis of the logs
themselves.

## Using GCViewer for Log Parsing as an API

```java
package klauern;

import com.tagtraum.perf.gcviewer.imp.DataReaderException;
import com.tagtraum.perf.gcviewer.imp.DataReaderFacade;
import com.tagtraum.perf.gcviewer.model.*;

import java.util.Iterator;

public class EventParser {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws DataReaderException {
        System.out.println("Getting DataReader facade");
        DataReaderFacade drf = new DataReaderFacade();
        System.out.println("Loading model");
        GCModel model = drf.loadModel(new GCResource("src/test/resources/gc-log.current"));
        System.out.println("Model Loaded");

        System.out.println("List Full GC Events:\n");
        Iterator<GCEvent> full_gcs = model.getFullGCEvents();
        while (full_gcs.hasNext()) {
            GCEvent event = full_gcs.next();
            System.out.println("Date: " + event.getDatestamp() + " Pause: " + event.getPause());
        }
        System.out.println("List stop the world events:\n");
        Iterator<AbstractGCEvent<?>> stw_events = model.getStopTheWorldEvents();
        while (stw_events.hasNext()) {
            AbstractGCEvent<?> event = stw_events.next();
            System.out.println("Type: " + event.getTypeAsString() + " Date: " + event.getDatestamp() + " Pause: " + event.getPause());
        }

        System.out.println("List CMS GC events");
        Iterator<ConcurrentGCEvent> cms_gc_events = model.getConcurrentGCEvents();
        while (cms_gc_events.hasNext()) {
            ConcurrentGCEvent event = cms_gc_events.next();
            System.out.println("Date: " + event.getDatestamp() + " Pause: " + event.getPause());
        }
    }
}
```

This is just so simple, you have a lot at your fingertips.  Running this little
sample code on one of my example JVM logs produces the following:

```
Getting datareader facade
Loading model
Model Loaded
List Full GC Events:

List stop the world events:

.... # continues for a while

Date: 2016-02-11T15:04:29.004-06:00 Pause: 0.0
Date: 2016-02-11T15:04:34.463-06:00 Pause: 3.232
Date: 2016-02-11T15:04:34.463-06:00 Pause: 0.0
Date: 2016-02-11T15:04:34.491-06:00 Pause: 0.028
```

From this point, I can really pull together some good statistics on frequency,
rate of growth, high-activity, and create those smell tests that you wish you
knew before something blew up in your face.  In my work experience, it's not
often that people do enough testing with production-sized loads, or if they do,
they underestimate what those load look like.  It's the worst possible scenario
to have poor performance only in your production environment, as it is
a possible indicator that these kind of GC-related events were present in your
testing but were completely missed or avoided because they weren't visible.
