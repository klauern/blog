# Moving into Leadership

How often have you seen someone in a leadership or management position get
demoted or reassigned back to a more technical or previous role in an
organization?  How often have you seen someone get let go after being promoted
into a leadership position?  How often do you see someone stay in a position
they're not qualified for?

Personally, of the 3 choices (demotion, firing, staying), I've seen people in
larger organizations stay in their position much, much longer than they probably
should have, or at least longer than they needed to know they were struggling
with the added responsibilities.

Coming from a military background, I have a completely different viewpoint on
how leaders are **made**.  For a lot of people, leadership something that
you just "find" yourself into.  I know that for a lot of organizations, there's
the ability to move up a technical or manager track, but in many organizations,
they either don't have that, or aren't large enough to keep both tracks.  In the
latter event, you find that you're faced with a tough choice in terms of career
development and/or salary:  do I change jobs?  Do I move up to management to get
that next big pay raise?

I'm willing to be that for most, it's something that you work your way up to.
Once you reach a pinnacle of what a company or organization is able to provide
you in terms of challenges, you tend to find yourself looking at the next set of
challenges being not technical, but social.

# Leadership Skills

A leader is someone that is expected to both

1) know his team's technical issues
2) ...as well as their personal ones.
3) and is able to help them solve/resolve both

You usually end up with a lot more work on your plate, with little more than
a title.  You have to do things to earn Respect, Trust, Confidence, and all
while maintaining the appearance of composure and competence.

There are a lot of good posts by others that I will hopefully link to in future
posts about what makes great leaders, but needless to say, it's a very big
change in your life, mostly because it's not at all the same as the technical
position you probably held before.

## Missing Skills

What bothers me the most about promotions is that when we promote someone to
a position of leadership, they seldom have the tools to take on all the added
complexity of interacting with people and the social, and interpersonal aspects
of leading.

This can be fixed with training, counseling, and regular interaction and
guidance, but I don't think it's dealt with well-enough.

I've known too many leaders that fail in doing one or more of the
following:

* Talking regularly with your team to know what they're doing
* Understanding your team's issues (be it technical or personal)
* Making choices that benefit the team's best interests
* Defending and supporting your team when they're challenged or pressured from
  the outside
* Dealing with the complexity of poor performance, prejudices, various "-isms",
    and training the team to be respectful and open-minded

# Training / Mentorship

This is not just a complex task, but a monumental one.  How many people have
enough exposure with **any** of these to really be able to take the reins of
a leadership position and not stumble with these?

For a lot of cases, I think that there's little chance to be trained on these
kinds of situations, and it tends to be a "Trial By Fire" situation.  Poor life
ahead for the team stuck with a manager having to learn on their feet with these
situations.

So, in many cases, leadership should not hesitate to find out how a new leader
is doing to be able to make the appropriate choices.  A Team Lead's Leader
should be able to determine if his/her team is struggling or thriving, and
provide ample guidance and mentorship in this area.
