# A 'meh' language, with a stellar platform

I keep finding myself toying with Go, thinking of throwing together projects
with it.  It's hard to really appreciate it until you take it's entire framework
together as a full set.  In much the same way, I appreciate and enjoy coding in
Java.  Not so much for Java's language features (I'd hardly call
Java-the-language cutting edge), but more for the entire platform and community
around it.
