My company has a way to propose new ideas, requiring some validation of the
process before allowing people to just go into it.  There is one policy that
they have not pursued with any real fervor that I would love to see made more
relevant: work from home.

# Current Flexible Work Policy

Right now, the current policy does offer some flexible work arrangements.  It
varies, and I know that some people have very different work arrangements than
myself, but what is set in policy is the following:

# Work From Home

You are allowed to take one day a week away from work.  This isn't much, but
it's more than nothing.  That said, it means that employees already have one
foot in the door to pursue a broader scope for what *work from home* means, and
I think we can expand that.

# Friday's Off

In addition to this small olive branch, they allow you to work 9-hour days
instead of the usual 8-hour day to get either:

1. every **other** Friday off
2. every Friday afternoon off

Which is nice, and was something I was pretty keen on when I started working
here years ago.  I took advantage of taking every-other Friday off, but found
myself pretty burned out after using it for a while.  It was nice, but the
9 hour days got the better of me.  Now I have just a regular 8-hour day and
accept the lost day off in return for my sanity.

Anyways, I've been hearing and reading a lot about more work from home
arrangements, and would pine for a more permanent work from home policy.  There
are many days where I would love to just wake up, start my day, make some
coffee, and get things done.  As it stands, I probably spend 1-1 1/2 hours a day
preparing for and commuting to and from work at the office.  This includes, but
is not limited to:

1. making my lunch (I'm a brown-bagger, and can't afford to spend money on
   catered lunch every day).
2. Getting dressed (corporate casual, slacks, loafers, etc.).  Not too much of
   burden, but it does require some coordination and effort.
3. Commuting to work (~25-30 minutes from the heart of Madison to it's furthest
   East-ward city boundary).
4. Commuting back from work (~25-30 minutes again).


I would say this adds at least an hour to my day, and that's not including the
mental energy that comes with having forgotten something when I get to work, or
having to worry about scheduling issues with kids, my wife's schedule, traffic
delays, car trouble, getting sick halfway through the day and having to go home,
etc., etc.

# A Proposal

To bring this back to the initial topic of this post, I found that the company
is pushing for more innovation and trying to be a leader.  My suggestion would
be to increase the amount of WFH time to be >75% of your average month.  This
can be worked out as either:

1. One day in the office a week
2. One week in the office a month

While my idea of increased work from home may not sound like your average innovative change,
I believe it would be huge, for a couple reasons:

1. There are some studies showing increased productivity for remote workers in
   terms of health and the flexibility it introduces.
2. Depending on the person, it's easier mentally to dive in to work than prepare
   every day for it.
3. You now broaden your hiring base to anyone with a working internet
   connection.
   * One caveat is if you require US Citizens, in which case, you're probably
       limited to the 50 States and US citizens.  Oh well.  Either way, you've
       just increased the flexibility for employees to be hundreds or
       *thousands* of miles away.
4. Your salaries are now competitve to the national market, which means that
   it's possible for someone working in a lower cost-of-living adjusted area to
   make a significantly increased salary compared to his/her peers.  This can
   backfire on you in that you may not be competitive to national salaries.
   However, it becomes obvious that you weren't competitive **before** you went
   with a remote workforce, so really, where was the downside?
5. Increased employee loyalty due to point #4.  It's *hard* to find a company
   that wants to pay you well for yoru job, **and** allow you to work remotely.

I will definitely have to add some more as I find the resources.  Right now,
I am a convert, but I don't have any solid evidence beyond the empirical points
above that I can try to cite.

Anyways, here's the set of questions that would need to be answered:
