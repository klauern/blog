If you spend time with anyone in the National Guard or one of the various military branches in the Reserves, you may notice that they don't typify the sales pitch that we are told about part-time Reservist: "Serve your country one weekend a month, two weeks in a year".

Yeah, if only it were that simple.

Most of my time away is spent doing some form of training.  These can be for an individual or group-related training.  As is the case with monthly drill weekends with your unit, it's not a great strategy to try to do all your training on a Saturday/Sunday block and expect anything to get accomplished.  Instead, many units employ the strategy of taking 2 days to a future month and allocating it to a different month, making that Saturday/Sunday weekend a Thursday through Sunday or Saturday through Tuesday kind of event.

This is great for training, as it allows you to have nearly a week of unrestricted time with your Soldiers (or Sailors, Marines, what-have-you) and get a lot of training done.  It also has the added benefit of turning those first couple days into 18-20 hours.  Assuming that you were to have a normal Saturday-Sunday weekend with your unit, you would rarely try to eat up much time on Sunday, as you know that everybody has to travel a distance back home (sometimes a couple hours drive after the day is over).  This means that most days end around 4-6PM, and you are limited in what you can do with that time.

If you have a 4-day weekend, well, things get more interesting.  You usually have to allocate barracks and travel to a base, so you're not even going to be at your unit.  On top of that, the schedule for meals can be simplified a bit as well, by being able to allocate an MRE for lunch, having to avoid having any meal planned or scheduled out for lunch at all.  This is great for training, and I'm not going to say I enjoy it, but I understand it.  Additionally, your typical day can start at 6AM, because you are already **there** and ready to go.

Even better, when does the day end?  Well, not at 6PM, that's for sure!  You can eat dinner, but you can also get a lot  of additional training and individualized counselings, paperwork, etc., after dinner, so your day could end closer to 10PM and it would be just fine!

Seriously, though, it's a lot better for a unit to allocate your time to serve this way, as you get more time to be a Soldier, and less time having to worry about where you packed your stuff for the next month.  It's also fun when you can skip a month or two (often, July and January are skipped at our units, simply because it's easier).
