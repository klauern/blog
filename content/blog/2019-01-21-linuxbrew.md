I haven't been an active Mac OS X user for a few years, but when I did, I was a **huge** fan of [Homebrew][brew].  I know that most (all?) Linux distros come with their own package managers (Arch being among my favs), being able to install packages without `sudo` permissions has been a bit of a chore.  When possible, I prefer to run in an environment that I can do this (especially if it's a work machine), but it wasn't until recently that they opened up a beta for [LinuxBrew][linuxbrew]: [Homebrew 1.9.0 - beta support for WSL on Win10][wsl]
